                “dataBase is a fantastic application that has brought statistical insights to to my game that I have never thought were possible. From a college player’s perspective, it is critical to understand where you stand and what kind of player you are to grow and get better…. with dataBase this process becomes simple. I believe the introduction of dataBase to any program will result in positive outcomes”
